							<p>Malware is constantly evolving and is a hot topic in cyber security. Not so much in my area of interest, blockchain security as it is permanently written onto the blockchain, the code can’t be change. Therefore, malware is more malicious functions which only when called upon by someone with privileged access or obfuscation of function names although some functions are solely for malicious use, they can be hard to spot. Back to traditional malware while it is generally used with malicious intent as the name would indicate it is also used frequently in pentesting an organizations computer network for human vulnerabilities in the system. People are always the weakest link in any security system as they are easier to manipulate than code. Malware honeypots are used to detect malware, these employ well-known replication and attack vectors. Honeypots (for example, Ghost) have been designed to mimic a USB storage device. If a machine becomes infected with malware that spreads through USB, the honeypot will trick the malware into infecting the emulated device.</p>
							<p>Malware analysis is a type of incident response but also used in reverse engineering malware. When analysing malware, you need to know the point of entry, if there are any indicators of malware being executed, where does it go and what does the malware do and if it can be reversed or prevented from spreading. There are two main types of malware campaigns targeted and mass. Targeted campaigns like DarkHotel targets government and military infrastructure and the senior individuals in those organizations. DarkHotel uses Zero-Day exploits and stays dormant until it identifies a high-profile target. Crouching Yeti (Energetic Bear) is another targeted malware however to date it only uses non Zero-Day exploits that are well known. Mass campaigns are indiscriminate and target any machine possible and are usually ransomware. WannaCry is a great example and crippled infrastructure worldwide in 2017. WannaCry is a crypto ransomware not because the ransom was to be paid in Bitcoin but that it encrypts data as opposed to the type of ransomware that locks you out of a system, this is known as locker ransomware. The interesting thing about the version of WannaCry responsible for the incident in 2017 was that windows had released a fix for the EternalBlue exploit used to attack SMB protocol two months prior to WannaCry being released and could have been avoided if big organizations updated their operating systems. This goes to show how important it is to keep your security software up to date.</p>
							<p>Malware analysts categorize the fingerprints of an incident into two types, host-based signatures which are usually the result of already executed malware on the host system. The second being network-based signatures which can be detected by unusual network traffic or increased traffic of a certain SMB protocol as we as many other methods. There are many tools you can use in static analysis such as those used in the TryHackMe room, PeID, IDA freeware, PE Explorer and the sysinternals strings tool but there are others available such as Ghidra a software reverse engineering framework maintained by the National Security Agency that hosts a suite of software analysis tools but will never actually execute code. Just like static analysis there are many tools available like Process Explorer, ApateDNS, Netcat, Wireshark and INetSim. There are also online tools such a Virus Total and Cuckoo Sandbox. Many of the tools in both categories can visualize the data, some will even create flow charts and output the imports and strings.</p>
							<p>Hashing is a huge part of malware analysis and due to the link for HashTab in the TryHackMe room was no longer valid Hashing is a huge part of malware analysis and due to the link for HashTab in the TryHackMe room was no longer valid I had to do some research on how to obtain a SHA256 hash as well as a MD5 hash as MD5 hashes are technically broken, after SHA256 will be SHA512 to keep up with demand. MD5 hash collisions can be an attack vector. For my Kali VM I found gtkhash which has just about every hash type possible and for windows I can use the power shell command “Get-Filehash” to get a specific hash result. Using these I can check them on Virus Total to check against the vast database on the information what the file is based on the hash provided. It is important to note that the hex value for an executable file is always “4D 5A” so checking this value on any suspected malicious file should be the first thing to do. This can be done using HxD Hex Editor on windows and with the “xxd” command in a terminal.</p>
							<p>Packaging is one way of obfuscation hiding the code that is intended not to be publicly viewable. This can be for legitimate and malicious intent. PeID is a useful tool here as it can detect what packager has been used to package the file. It can then be loaded into a disassembly/decompilation tool like IDA freeware and see what results are returned, or more importantly what you can’t see. Obfuscated files will generally show very few processes happening and an un-obfuscated file will have a lot of data to go through. There is an imports tab to make it easy to find what is being imported. Strings are the ASCII human readable contents of a program and could be anything from password to website domains or even cryptocurrency addresses. On windows I can use the command prompt and navigate to the sysinternals then use the “strings” command followed by the file path to show visible strings. This is not very efficient, and it would be better to use a disassembly/decompilation tool. I learned a lot while going through this room and the lecture. Learning to complete the same tasks on Kali Linux system was a lesson itself.</p>
