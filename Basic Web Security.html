							<h1 class="major">Basic Web Application Security Using BurpSuite</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic14.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>On joining the Juice Shop room and opening task one I am given an overview that I will be covering OWASPs to ten vulnerabilities however the room only covers injection, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure, broken access control and cross-site scripting (XSS). Using what I learned completing BurpSuite Basics, after loading BurpSuite is go to the target tab and then the scope subtab to add the IP address provided to the include in scope section. Then I go to the proxy tab then the options subtab and enable the And-URL-Is-in-target-scope option to only target traffic to and from the target. Before continuing I enable foxy proxy for BurpSuite and turn intercept off in the proxy to record the data transferred while conducting my passive recon.</p>
							<p>I browsed the Juice Shop website and found the following pages that allowed user input and possible attack vectors. These included the following pages, login, forgot password, user registration, customer feedback and a search bar. As indicated by the task when a user leaves a comment it shows the email associated with that user, including admins. Next, I preform a search for a Green Smoothie and in the parameter for the search query in the URL which was “q”. Its is noted that jim has left a comment so when looking at the comment I can get the users email address and a reference in the comment to a replicator. This is still passive recon and a very simple example as I am given all information.</p>
							<p>Now I got to learn about injection vulnerabilities and that there are many types but three were named, SQL injection, command injection, email injection and explanations for each given. In this task I will be looking at SQL injection. Firstly, I must turn intercept on again in the BurpSuite proxy so I can start intercepting data for manipulation. Following the task, I navigated to the login page and attempted to login with the email address “a” and the password “a” and captured the request in the BurpSuite proxy. After capturing the request, I was instructed to change the email address field from “a” to “’ or 1=1--" and after forwarding the request I am now logged in as the administrator’s user account. I learned that this works because “’” closes the bracket in a SQL query enabling me to and the “OR” statement adding “1=1” as it is always true and “--" make any input after being interpreted as a comment and disregarded from the SQL statement. Repeating the process and replacing “’ or 1=1--" with benders email given to me with “bender@juice-sh.op’--" I am logged in as bender, this worked because benders email is valid so always true and the “--" command bypassed the password verification.</p>
							<p>Looking at broken authentication and mechanisms to exploit weak passwords on high privileged accounts and forgotten password pages, using the BurpSuite intruder tab to brute force the admin password by using a payload. There are four types of attack I could use and have used in other rooms but for this I will be using the sniper attack as there is only one input method to attack which is the password. The task says to use the best1050.txt file from SecLists found in the wordlist folder. After capturing a login request using the admin@juice-sh.op email address I forwarded it to the intruder to prepare my attack. I must clear the § wrappers and then only add them to the password parameter and on the payloads tab select simple word list and add the best1050.txt file in the payload options then start the attack. Looking for successful request 200 and not unauthorized 401 can be found by toggling the status tab. From other rooms I have learnt that a status code wont always reveal the results and the length is a good way to check for success. The password admin123 has returned with a status code of 200 so looks like the password. Using the proxy to change the password to “admin123” and forwarding it to the server I am now logged in as the admin again. Following the next part involved more recon but the information required was given but demonstrated how to exploit the password reset page using information publicly available.</p>
							<p>This part is about sensitive data exposure and I am shown a way to find potentially publicly accessible file directories, in this case an ftp directory, Navigating to this page in a browser I am able to easily see the acquisitions.md file and download it. However when trying to download the package.json.bak I receive an error 403 message saying only .md and .pdf files are allowed. Here I learn about the Poison Null Byte “%00” or “%2500 in URL encoded format. Adding this to the URL at a certain byte will nullify the rest of the string allowing to bypass the final check and download the file. The next part shows how to exploit broken access control and explains the two types which are horizontal privilege escalation and vertical privilege escalation. The main things I learned here was how to find paths to potentially exploit by searching the main.js file. And how to exploit the GET request in BurpSuite by changing the path destination allowing me to view other users information.</p>
							<p>In the final part is about XSS and was tasked with performing three types of attack. A DOM XSS attack, here I had to insert a script “iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)"” into the search bar and received an alert saying XSS indicating the website is vulnerable to XSS attacks. Then I had to perform a persistent XSS attack, I did this by navigating to and capturing the page required in BurpSuite and under the headers tab edited the True-Client-IP value to the “iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)"” script, then forwarded the request to the server. Signing back in and navigating to the same page revealed the XSS alert indicating vulnerability. The last one was a reflected XSS attack. After navigating to the required page I carried out this attack using the URL bar adding the same script as before after the ?id= like so “?id=iframe src="javascript:alert(`xss`)"” after submitting the request and refreshing the page I get the same XSS alert. It is noted that user input sanitation is often used, and I have learned in later rooms that there are many ways around this including polyglot scripts. BurpSuite is one of my most used tools.</p>
